**(Q1) What is Emmet ?**

Ans:- Emmet (formerly known as Zen Code) is basically we can say it as shorthand, with it one can easily write a lot of code quickly. It dramatically speeds up your   HTML & CSS workflow.

For instance **div#hero.wrapper** can also be written below using emmet as
           <div id="hero" class="wrapper"></div>
