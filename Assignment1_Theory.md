**(Q2) Difference between a Library and Framework?**

**Ans:- **  The difference lies between inversion of control, which provide what.

           **Library**

           We can simply say library consists of set of functions and that being used repeatedly which are written by us, those functions are controlled by us. So,When we use libarary, we control the flow of our code.
           
           **Framework**

           Where as framework consists of lot of libraries, the control is reversed, which means that the framework tells the developer where code needs to be provided and calls it as it requires..
